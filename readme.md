Wouldn't it be nice if you could:

``` html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>This is thepage</h1>
        <script src="./footer.html"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Well, you can!
You just need to decorate the html in `footer.html` with a special, magic comment. The included file (footer.html) is valid html, so search engines will like it.
